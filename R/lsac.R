#' Synthetic Data: Longitudinal Study of Australian Children
#'
#' This synthetic dataset, based on
#' ["Growing Up in Australia - the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children" (LSAC)](https://aifs.gov.au/growing-up-in-australia).
#' This longitudinal study covers a representative sample of about 10.000
#' children and their families, and aims to examine children's development
#' from early childhood through to adolescence and adulthood.
#' All variables pertain to the mother; note that fathers also play an important
#' and sometimes unique role in children's emotional development.
#'
#' Except for "coping", all variables were created by taking the row means of
#' several items, omitting missing values. The corresponding item names from the
#' LSAC codebook are given below.
