Description: An integrated suite of tools for creating, maintaining, and reusing
    FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) theories.
    Designed to support transparent and collaborative theory development,
    the package enables users to formalize theories,
    track changes with version control,
    assess pre-empirical coherence,
    and derive testable hypotheses.
    Aligning with open science principles and workflows,
    'theorytools' facilitates the systematic improvement of theoretical frameworks
    and enhances their discoverability and usability.
