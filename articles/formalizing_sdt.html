<p>This vignette is based on work conducted as part of the “Proposition
Based Theory Specification” (PBTS) project by Andreas Glöckner, Susann
Fiedler, Jennifer Biehl, &amp; Jasper Siol (in preparation). In this
“many-theorists project”, groups of scholars were each assigned a
chapter of the “Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology” <span class="citation">(Van Lange, Kruglanski, and Higgins 2012)</span>, and
asked to specify it and document the process.</p>
<p>Van Lissa, Li, and Weber set out to formalize Deci and Ryan’s
<em>Self-Determination Theory</em>, documented in Chapter 20 of the book
<span class="citation">(Deci and Ryan 2012)</span>. The definition of
SDT used for the theory specification exercise was taken from this book
chapter, but seems to be fully consistent with the description on <a href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/" class="external-link uri">https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>In the first step of the PBTS procedure, we were asked to select
sources for the theory specification and agree on these sources with
fellow raters; to detect relevant text snippets within these sources
that contain descriptions of the definitions, causal relations, et
cetera as proposed by the theory; and to agree with the fellow coders on
these snippets. We decided to use only the book chapter as a source. As
an example, the first snippet we selected was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For these natural, active processes of intrinsic motivation and
integration to operate effectively toward healthy development and
psychological well-being, human beings need particular nutriments – both
biological and psychological (Ryan, 1995). In the relative absence of
such nutriments, these natural processes will be impaired, resulting in
experiences, development, and behaviors that are less than optimal.
(Deci &amp; Ryan, 2012, p. 417)</p>

<p><strong>Snippet 1:</strong> “For these natural, active processes of

<p><strong>Snippet 2:</strong> “The three basic psychological needs are

<p><strong>Snippet 4:</strong> “[Intrinsic motivation] could be either
undermined or enhanced depending on whether the social environment
supported or thwarted the needs for competence and self-determination.
If a reward or other external event such as threat of punishment (Deci
and Cascio, 1972), positive feedback (Deci, 1971), competition (Deci and
Betley et al., 1981), or choice (Zuckerman et al., 1978) were expected
to thwart these basic needs, it was predicted to prompt an external
perceived locus of causality and undermine intrinsic motivation; but if
the event were expected to support these basic needs, it was predicted
to prompt an internal perceived locus of causality and enhance intrinsic
motivation.” (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2012, p. 418)</p>

</h2>
<p>Each individual coder then set out to extract a set of IF-THEN
propositions from the selected snippets that, together, describe the
theory.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the first snippet, and code it for implied causality.
The causes are coded in green, and outcomes in blue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For these natural, active <font color="green"><strong>processes of
intrinsic motivation and integration</strong></font> to operate
effectively toward <font color="blue"><strong>healthy development and
psychological well-being</strong></font>, human beings need particular
<font color="green"><strong>nutriments</strong></font> – both
biological and psychological (Ryan, 1995). In the relative absence of
such <font color="green"><strong>nutriments</strong></font>, these
natural <font color="blue"><strong>processes</strong></font> will be
impaired, resulting in <font color="blue"><strong>experiences,
development, and behaviors</strong></font> that are less than optimal”
(Lange et al., 2012, p. 417)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text is a bit ambiguous, and possibly redundant. We see that
<strong>processes</strong>, in the first sentence, refers to intrinsic
motivation and integration. This invites the question of the
relationship between intrinsic motivation and integration - do they go
hand in hand (i.e., just two examples of processes set in motion by
nutriments)? Are they distinct but similarly related to other
constructs? It’s not clear. Furthermore, in the second sentence, we find
the word <strong>processes</strong> again, but this time without
explicit reference to intrinsic motivation and integration. For now, we
will assume that intrinsic motivation and integration are distinct but
have similar relationships to other constructs, and that the word is
used consistently across both sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Nutriments</strong> is defined elsewhere in the text - it
appears to refer to refer to the three basic needs, as well as
biological necessities.</p>
<p><strong>Experiences, development, and behaviors</strong> is not
well-defined, but we might assume it refers back to <strong>healthy
development and psychological well-being</strong>.</p>
<p>We could reconstruct implied propositions as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Processes (intrinsic motivation AND integration) -&gt; healthy
development AND psychological well-being (<em>processes of intrinsic
motivation and integration [operate effectively toward] healthy
development and psychological well-being</em>)</li>
<li>Nutriments -&gt; Processes (<em>human beings [need] nutriments […]
for these processes to operate etc.</em>)</li>
<li>Nutriments -&gt; Processes (<em>In the [absence of] nutriments […]
processes will be impaired</em>)</li>
<li>Processes -&gt; Healthy development AND psychological well-being
(<em>processes will be impaired, resulting in experiences, development,
and behaviors</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that our interpretations are correct, we see that the
snippet redundantly states the same two relationships twice; once
phrased in the positive and once in the negative.</p>
<p>Let’s apply the same coding procedure to all snippets:</p>

</h3>
<p>The IF-THEN specification prescribed by the PBTS framework has some
limitations here; for example, it is not so well-suited to describe a
difference in degrees (people are affected a little bit), or a
probabilistic effect (some people are affected, but not all). Except
proposition #3, which explicitly states that people are universally
affected, none of the original statements appear to be binary. However,
the direction of causality is relatively clear. Thus, a better fit might
be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which incurs the additional advantage
of being X-interoperable with covariate selection and data generation
(see <a href="https://cjvanlissa.github.io/theorytools/articles/causal-inference.html">this
vignette</a>).</p>
<p>We can translate these IF-THEN statements into causal links between
specific constructs. The result is contained in a file included in the
<code>theorytools</code> package, which we load below. Note that the
numbers associated with the statements are retained, so that it is clear
which causal links are derived from which IF/THEN statements:</p>

<p>This translation reveals some further ambiguities; for example, in
proposition #4, we see “rewards” are related to intrinsic motivation.
However, in the remainder of the text, rewards are mentioned as just one
example of “external events”. We assumed that “rewards” is used as an
example of the broader class of external events.</p>
<p>Another ambiguity: we read that “If [an external event] were expected
to thwart [basic needs], it [prompts] an external perceived locus of
causality”. Since the theory otherwise does not explain how people might
“expect” that external events will affect them, and this seems to be
more of a question for cognitive than social psychology - we made a
simplifying assumption: external events affect needs, and also perceived
locus of causality.</p>
<p>This specification also reveals redundancies in the original theory.
Many propositions are repeated, once phrased in a positive way, and once
phrased in a negative way. This can be confusing, especially if the two
phrasings differ slightly; for example, in snippet #1, the positive
phrasing refers to “healthy development and psychological well-being” as
ultimate outcome of need satisfaction, and the negative phrasing refers
to “experiences, development, and behaviors” as ultimate outcomes of
need frustration. While it seems safe to assume that both sentences have
the same meaning, there is ambiguity here. When the statements are
reduced to their implied causal connections, the redundancies become
readily apparent. We can simply remove the redundancies as follows:</p>

referred to by the author of the theory. In principle, we were asked to
refer to text snippets from the sources determined in Step 1. However,
in case definitions were not provided by the author (which was the case
for all constructs in this theory), we were allowed to derive them from
the scientific literature. When operationalizations could not be derived

<p>As can be seen fom this overview - none of the definitions were given
in the theory chapter. We were able to trace some definitions to
empirical papers cited in the chapter, but these definitions appeared to
fall short of proper “theoretical definitions”. For example,
<strong>intrinsic motivation</strong> was defined as “number of seconds
spent working on a puzzle”. This is a purely behaviorist definition of
an internal state.</p>
<p>In other words: While the theory is relatively explicit about causal
links between constructs (with just a few ambiguities), it appears that
important work remains to be done in terms of defining the constructs
involved in the theory. While it is possible and likely that domain
experts would be able to easily resolve some of these ambiguities and
definitions, this is the best we could do. We will now create a FAIR
theory archive, and invite others to further develop this theory.</p>

<p>We will automate most steps of FAIR theory creation; to go through
the process manually, see <a href="https://cjvanlissa.github.io/theorytools/articles/fair-theory.html">this

the causal relations, and a spreadsheet containing the definitions.</p>

</h3>
<p>We customized the README by adding these sections:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This is a FAIR theory (Van Lissa et al.,
2025) specification of Deci and Ryan’s <em>Self-Determination
Theory</em> (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2012). The definition of SDT used for the
theory specification exercise was taken from this book chapter, but
seems to be fully consistent with the description on <a href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/" class="external-link uri">https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/the-theory/</a>.<br>
The theory was first specified by Van Lissa, Li, and Weber as part of
the “Proposition Based Theory Specification” (PBTS) project by Andreas
Glöckner, Susann Fiedler, Jennifer Biehl, &amp; Jasper Siol (in
preparation). In this “many-theorists project”, groups of scholars were
each assigned a chapter of the “Handbook of Theories of Social
Psychology” <span class="citation">(Van Lange, Kruglanski, and Higgins
2012)</span>, and asked to specify it and document the process.<br>
Van Lissa further adapted the theory specification, as documented in <a href="https://cjvanlissa.github.io/theorytools/articles/formalizing_sdt.html">this
vignette</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong><br><code>sdt.txt</code> This file contains the main theory, specified as a
DAG. It is interoperable for causal inference and data simulation in R,
as explained in <a href="https://cjvanlissa.github.io/theorytools/articles/causal-inference.html">this
vignette</a>.<br><code>definitions.csv</code> This file contains the definitions of the
constructs in <code>sdt.txt</code> we were able to find. At present,
this file is not very interoperable. We urgently invite domain experts
to propose more concrete definitions of the constructs (as our attempt
to identify the intended definitions likely fell short), or to propose
new and better definitions.</p>

<p>On the ‘Zenodo’ website navigate to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/" class="external-link">‘GitHub’ repository
listing page</a> and simply “flip the switch” next to your repository.
If your repository <strong>does not show up</strong> in the list, you
may need to press the ‘Synchronize now’ button. At the time of writing,
we noticed that it can take quite a while (hours?) for ‘Zenodo’ to
detect new ‘GitHub’ repositories. If so, take a break or come back to
this last step tomorrow!</p>
